# Environment Configuration Instructions

## Create a .env.local file in the Booking directory
Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the Booking directory with the following content:

```
# API configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Verify your backend is running
Make sure your backend server is running at http://localhost:5000 and that it has CORS properly configured to accept requests from your frontend.

## Check API prefix
Ensure that all API requests include the correct prefix: `/api/v1/`

## Restart your Next.js development server
After creating the .env.local file, restart your Next.js development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

## Development flow
1. Make sure backend server is running
2. Make sure frontend is running with proper environment variables
3. Try creating/viewing announcements with the updated URLs
